<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
   
<p>It has been more than a year and a half since the first lockdown announcement in North America. Pandemic has had a big impact not only on our lives but also on the cloud industry. On April 30th 2020, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said "We saw 2 years of digital transformation in 2 months". As we are seeing the light at the end of the covid tunnel, the rate of digitalization will likely deaccelerate. The beautiful part is that the cloud penetration will continue in post covid world. According to new CEO of Amazon Andy Jassy, a mere 4% of IT spending currently goes into the cloud. That being said there's still tremendous upside potential left.</p>
    <p>Till now on, the Cloud industries' focus was mostly on how to efficiently store and provide hosting services. The result was an oligopoly of a few giant players. Amazon, the number one IaaS/PaaS solution provider, Azure as the Second and Google, the third. The chance that these players to lose their shares from this framework is low because it is hard to differentiate themselves from each other at this stage.</p>
        <p>So, the vendors were seeking new opportunities outside of the existing scope. The result was the addition of analytical features and introduction of second generation of cloud computing service such as Serverless computing or Function as a Service. However, these changes are not big enough to shake the existing landscape.</p>
    <p>Along with the adoption of multi-clouds, the importance of data management is rising exponentially. As such, it is natural that the vendors' interest to shift from gathering data to processing data.</p>

    <h2><Strong>9. Why TPU over GPU?</Strong></h2>
<hr>
</div>

<div style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.7; color:black;">
<ul>
    <li>It seems natural for data professionals to use TPU because it is cheaper and faster than GPU</li>
    <li>The numbers of ALUs in TPUs are substantially higher than in GPUs making them a lot faster. <u>GPUs have between 2500 to 5000 ALUs per core, while TPUs have 32768 ALUs per core</u></li>
    <li>This chart compares the performance per WATT by processor released by Google. <Strong>At full operation, the economic feasibility of TPU is overwhelming.</Strong></li>

    <h2><Strong>10. The bottleneck</Strong></h2>
<hr>
</div>

<div style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.7; color:black;">
<ul>
        <li>The only concern for TPU is that if there is not enough data to fully operate the TPU, the relative performance drops sharply.  </li>
        <li>For example, most factories have to operate at full capacity to maximize profitability. The same logic applies to TPUs. <Strong>The smaller the batch size of the training, the weaker the relative performance of TPU.</Strong> As the AI market is still in its early growth phase, <Strong>there are not enough users to use all the computational capacity of the TPUs.</Strong></li>
        <li>For this reason, whenever the benchmark is released every year, Nvidia's strategy of taking a realistic approach to AI development and Google's strategy of pursuing the eventual ideals collide.</li>

    <li>There was a major TPU usage <u>jump in 2021</u></li>
